We are back on the pitch this month as part of the Istanbul University League. Training intensity has jumped and the squad balance feels right: pace up top, patient middle order, and electric fielders.

**Key storylines**

- *New-ball pair*: Emre and Hassan bring raw pace that should trouble Bilkent early.
- *Spin depth*: Esra's left-arm orthodox adds control through the middle overs.
- *Student energy*: 6 first-year students earned call-ups thanks to relentless fitness work.

Bring your friends, wear red, and help us turn the boundary ropes into a wall of noise.
